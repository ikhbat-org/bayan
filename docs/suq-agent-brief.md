# Sūq → Bayan: round-3 review input and Sūq-0 goldens

From Sy, for the compiler agent. This follows `docs/bayan-status-for-suq.md` (commit `af964b5`, `feat/design-round-2`).

The round-3 plan (J1–J25) is awaiting Sy's approval. This document feeds Sūq's findings into that plan before approval, and adds a first compilable slice of Sūq as golden tests.

## What to do

1. **Part A.** Apply Sy's decisions to the round-3 docs on `feat/design-round-3`: the round-3 design doc (`docs/bayan-design-round-3.md`), plan, SPEC and GRAMMAR. If the round-3 docs already decide an item differently, keep the decision below and record the conflict in your response. Don't silently pick one.
2. **Part B.** Map each open friction item to a round-3 plan step, or propose a new one. Say whether the round-3 docs already answer it.
3. **Part C.** Check that every round-3 audit fix appears in the round-3 GRAMMAR/SPEC.
4. **Part D.** Add the Sūq-0 goldens on `feat/design-round-2` and make them pass without editing any expected output.
5. **Part E.** Write `docs/suq-round3-review-response.md` with everything listed there, and replace the two Sūq files in `docs/` with the versions attached to this message.

The attached `suq-reference-app.zip` and `bayan-reference-app-friction.md` replace the copies in `docs/`. They include a double-check pass: 15 fixed bugs plus one found while writing Sūq-0 (`-|` on signed types).

---

## Part A — Decisions for the round-3 plan

Each item gives what the compiler implements now, then Sy's decision. Apply the decision to the round-3 docs; it lands in code with the matching J step.

**A1. When a `defer` modifier is evaluated.**
- Now: `defer stmt if c` evaluates `c` at scope exit.
- **Decision: at registration, as round-3 J20 says.** Evaluated at exit, the modifier is just `defer { if c … }`, so it adds nothing. Sūq's restock script relies on registration timing: `defer log("dry run: rolled back") if options.dryRun`.
- Add the pending golden in Part D7.

**A2. `fail` vs `return .variant` for errors.**
- Now: `return .invalid`.
- **Decision: a `fail` statement.** In a function that returns a union value and also fails, `return .badRequest` (a value) and `return .overflow` (an error) look identical. Sūq has this in every HTTP handler (`-> Response fails …`).
- `fail .x if cond` and `?? fail .x` follow from this.
- `return .x` in a fallible function becomes an input form with a fix-it, but only when the return type isn't a union containing `.x`.

**A3. Binding a payload in a switch arm.**
- Now: positional, `.circle(let r)` (Q45).
- **Decision: keep positional, and add whole-value binding:** `.percentOff p => p.rate`, where `p` is narrowed to that case. This matches `catch switch { DbError e => … }` and reads better for payloads with three or more fields.

**A4. Numeric conversions.**
- Now: C# casts `(T)x`, checked. These already forced a parser workaround (`if (i32)big > 3`) against the no-parentheses-on-conditions rule.
- **Decision: `T(x)`, checked (traps when out of range), with `T.tryFrom(x)` returning `T?`.**
- `(T)x` becomes an input form with a fix-it.

**A5. Copying a borrowed string.**
- Now: there's no `owned()`; the idiom is `$"{s}"`.
- **Decision: `s.copy()`, matching collections' `.copy(to: arena)`. `s.copy(to: arena)` also exists.** Sūq will replace `owned()` with it.

**A6. Asserting that a call fails.**
- Now: missing. The workaround is `f() catch { return; }` followed by `panic`.
- **Decision: `assert f() fails E.case`**, also `assert f() fails E` for any case of the set. It prints a power-assert tree when the call succeeds or fails differently.

**A7. Adopt implemented behaviour into the round-3 SPEC.** These were questions in Sūq's friction log; the compiler already answers them, and the answers are right.
- **F-12:** a struct holding a unique value is unique without the keyword. Extend the inference from collections to any unique field, such as a `SecretKey`. The explicit `struct unique` stays for raw resources.
- **F-14:** owning values never copy implicitly (BYN2780). Copies are explicit with `.copy(to:)`.
- **F-19:** fallible constructors are `T(x)`, with `T.tryFrom(x)` (like `string.tryFrom`) and `T.tryParse(text)` for text.
- **F-26:** the empty map literal is `[]` with a target type, not `[:]`.

## Part B — Open friction items to place in the plan

Full text is in `docs/bayan-reference-app-friction.md`. For each item, give the plan step it belongs to (or "new step"), and whether the round-3 docs already answer it and how.

| # | Area (round-3 §) | Sūq's proposal |
|---|---|---|
| F-02 | Testing | A `measure { }` block inside `bench` separates setup from the measured, budgeted part |
| F-03 | Laws | Fix `law` syntax and where the level (tested/exhaustive/proved) is set |
| F-05, F-06 | §14 Typestate | Syntax for constructing a value in a given state (Sūq assumed `Order.paid { … }`), and which state a plain literal starts in |
| F-07 | §11 `requires` | `with` is infallible when no changed field has a rule and no struct-level rule reads it |
| F-08 | §11 | Literal arguments and `const`s of `requires` types are checked at compile time, with no `try` |
| F-09 | §15 Particles | Exempt `extern` signatures, operators, union payloads and laws from the particle rule |
| F-10 | §17 / sql | Arguments after a `sql"…"` literal are variadic and checked against its `$n` count |
| F-11 | §17 Trust | An `Untrusted<bool>` is usable directly as a condition |
| F-13 | §17 | Columns or tables declared `untrusted`, read back as `Untrusted<T>` (for stored customer input) |
| F-16 | §11 | A struct-level rule that reads a field which itself failed is skipped; only the field's violation is reported |
| F-17 | §16 Secret | `requires` may read a `Secret`, so password fields can be `Secret<string>` |
| F-18 | Derived forms / regions | What an `XOp` value may capture when stored in a long-lived container |
| F-21 | §2 Declarations | Block-bodied computed properties: `public total: Money { … }` |
| F-22 | std | `sort` is stable; an unstable sort gets its own name |
| F-23 | §13 Concurrency | `Io.group(timeout:)` can map its deadline into the caller's error set once |
| F-24, F-25 | §8 Units / O2 | Reserve `Bytes` for the unit (data is `Span<u8>`); record how O2's integer counts mix with byte sizes |
| F-27 | Derived forms | Naming of `@forms(Op)` on free functions (`BookWithRetryOp`) |
| F-28 | §13 | A `@blocking` marker that warns when a CPU-heavy function is called outside `Io.offload` |
| F-29 | §18 Errors | Block arms and `return` arms in `catch switch` (Sūq-0 `suq-quote` uses `return` arms) |
| F-30 | FFI | `extern "lib" { … }` block syntax, and user-defined `drop` for `unique` types |
| F-31 | §12 Naming | Exempt static factories that name their result (`Money.zero(c)`, `Outbox.empty()`), following the spec's `T.zero` |
| F-33 | §16 Secret | `Secret` owns its storage and wipes it on drop |
| F-34 | §5 Control flow | `for (a, b) in xs` is tuple destructuring; only `for (x in xs)` is the rejected input form |

---

## Part C — Round-3 audit fixes to verify

These came out of an audit of the round-3 HANDOFF before it reached you, and should be in the version with O1–O10 resolved (`e60ab6f`). For each, cite the GRAMMAR/SPEC line, or say how the docs differ.

1. Waqf termination: a newline ends a statement unless the line ends with a binary operator, or the next line starts with `.`, `?.`, `??`, `except` or `requires`. A blank line always ends one.
2. Head-first declarations: `struct unique`, `type distinct`, `union error X { … }`, and `union error S = A, B` for composition. No `unique struct`, `error enum` or `error set`.
3. `@attr` attributes, camelCase. `because "…"` is required on `@allow`, `unsafe`, `xUnchecked()`, `trustUnchecked()` and `Secret.expose()`.
4. `requires it …` (not `value`). A struct-level rule is attributed to a field with `at .field` (O4).
5. Function types use `->` (O5), e.g. `onPaid: Order -> void uses net`.
6. `case not .x` (no `case _ except .x`).
7. Unit conversions: `x.convert(to: KiB)` and `t.round(to: Seconds)` (no `.in(...)`, `ceil`, `floor`).
8. `log(msg, as: .level)` (no `Log.debug`, no `at:`).
9. `provide name: handler { }` for effect handlers. No `context (…)` blocks; `context` is only the value.
10. No `noalloc`, `nosuspend` or `suspends`; effects are `uses …`, and no clause means pure.
11. `format()` / `formatInto(ref dst)`; no `toString()`; no string `+`.
12. Each open question's resolution, in the round-3 docs:
    - O1: one union case per line.
    - O2: counts (`length`, `runeCount`) are plain integers; units are for sizes and offsets.
    - O3: a rule is field-level or struct-level by content.
    - O4: `at .field`.
    - O5: `->` in function types.
    - O6: the `for` particle.
    - O7: `Money + Money` traps on mixed currencies; `tryAdd` and `add(…) fails` exist.
    - O8: `state` is contextual.
    - O9: no bare literals for distinct types.
    - O10: a decode from untrusted input is trusted only when no field is free text or bytes.

    If any resolution differs, quote what the docs decided. Sūq assumed these.

---

## Part D — Sūq-0 goldens (current syntax)

Four programs and one test file, written in the round-2 syntax the compiler implements at `af964b5`. They cover what compiles today: pricing, money, packing and the order lifecycle. Units, distinct types, typestate and `requires` on fields aren't implemented, so the slices use `i64` grams and basis points, runtime state checks, and explicit validation. Every expected output was generated from Sūq's C# baseline, which has 37 passing tests, including against PostgreSQL. The programs aren't guesses about the domain; they're a port.

### Rules

- **D1.** Add them as `tests/cases/run/suq-money.byn`, `suq-quote.byn`, `suq-packing.byn` and `suq-order.byn`, each with its `.stdout`, plus `suq-money.test.byn`. `suq-quote` and `suq-order` use `Money`/`Currency`/`PricingError` from `suq-money`. If run goldens are single-file, copy those declarations in, without the top-level statements.
- **D2. Never edit a `.stdout`.** If the output differs, find out whether it's a compiler bug or a bug in the slice, fix that, and report the diff and the cause.
- **D3. Make the smallest syntax changes that get each file to compile, and log every one** (file, line, what was written, what was needed, why). The log is the point of the exercise: it measures how far this code sits from the implemented language. Don't change any logic.
- **D4.** If a feature is missing (for example `return` arms in `catch switch`, a `const` array of structs, or `stackalloc` of `i64`), use the smallest workaround, log it, and open a Question if it belongs in the language.
- **D5. Zero allocations.** If the suite has an allocation-counting harness (as `LexerTests` does), add a test that `pack` on the 40-item sample allocates nothing after the spans are set up.
- **D6.** The naming checker skips free functions, so names here are already verbs where round 3 will require it (`findSmallestBox`, `sortPicks`, `computeCheckDigit`). Don't rename them.
- **D7. Pending golden for A1.** Add it as expected-to-fail until J20 lands:

  ```csharp
  // defer-modifier-registration.byn — the condition is read when the defer is registered
  void f() {
      var c = true;
      defer print("cleanup") if c;
      c = false;
      print("body");
  }
  f();
  ```

  Expected (registration time):

  ```
  body
  cleanup
  ```

  Today it prints only `body`.

### Assumed syntax

These are taken from the status report. Where a detail is wrong, D3 applies.

- `T name(params)`, `;`, `let`/`var`.
- `public` on every field used by other modules.
- Methods inside structs, with `ref this` for mutators.
- Unions with positional payloads; error enums with `///` summaries; `error set S = A, B;`.
- `return .case if cond;`, `catch (e) { … }`, `catch switch { Type => … }`.
- `[Cases(…)]` and `assert(…)`.
- `stackalloc`, `.asSpan`, `+%`, `*%`, `-|`, `(T)x` casts, `StrBuf`.
- `print(string)`.
- `list.add(x)` and `.length`: use whatever the current names are and log it.

### `suq-money.byn`

```csharp
// suq-money.byn — Sūq-0 slice 1: currency-safe money, formatting, error enums
// Written in round-2 syntax (what the compiler implements at af964b5).

/// An amount in minor units (sen, cents) of one currency.
public struct Money {
    public i64 cents;
    public Currency currency;

    public Money plus(Money other) fails PricingError {
        return .currencyMismatch if other.currency != currency;
        return .overflow if other.cents > 0 && cents > maxCents - other.cents;
        return Money { cents: cents + other.cents, currency: currency };
    }

    public Money minus(Money other) fails PricingError {
        return .currencyMismatch if other.currency != currency;
        return Money { cents: cents - other.cents, currency: currency };
    }

    public Money times(i32 qty) => Money { cents: cents * qty, currency: currency };

    /// This amount at a rate in basis points (800 = 8%), rounded half up. Non-negative amounts.
    public Money atRate(i64 basisPoints) fails PricingError {
        return .overflow if basisPoints > 0 && cents > (maxCents - 5000) / basisPoints;
        return Money { cents: (cents * basisPoints + 5000) / 10000, currency: currency };
    }

    /// Writes "MYR 12.50". Drives `$"{m}"`.
    public void formatInto(ref StrBuf sb) {
        sb.append(code(currency));
        sb.append(" ");
        var whole = cents;
        if cents < 0 {
            sb.append("-");
            whole = -cents;
        }
        sb.append($"{whole / 100}.");
        sb.append("0") if whole % 100 < 10;

    }
}

void tryAdd(Money a, Money b) {
    let sum = a.plus(b) catch (e) {

        print($"add: {name}");
        return;
    };
    print($"add: {sum}");
}

print($"{Money { cents: 1250, currency: .myr }}");
print($"{Money { cents: 5, currency: .myr }}");
print($"{Money { cents: -300, currency: .myr }}");
tryAdd(a: Money { cents: 100, currency: .myr }, b: Money { cents: 100, currency: .myr });
tryAdd(a: Money { cents: 100, currency: .myr }, b: Money { cents: 100, currency: .sgd });
tryAdd(a: Money { cents: maxCents, currency: .myr }, b: Money { cents: 1, currency: .myr });
let tax = try Money { cents: 1063, currency: .myr }.atRate(800);
print($"8% of MYR 10.63: {tax}");
print($"3 x MYR 12.50: {Money { cents: 1250, currency: .myr }.times(3)}");
```

Expected `suq-money.stdout`:

```
MYR 12.50
MYR 0.05
MYR -3.00
add: MYR 2.00
add: currencyMismatch
add: overflow
8% of MYR 10.63: MYR 0.85
3 x MYR 12.50: MYR 37.50
```

### `suq-money.test.byn`

```csharp
// suq-money.test.byn — the same rules as tests: [Cases], power asserts

[Cases((1250, "MYR 12.50"), (5, "MYR 0.05"), (-300, "MYR -3.00"), (0, "MYR 0.00"))]
test "format" (i64 cents, string text) {
    assert($"{Money { cents: cents, currency: .myr }}" == text);
}

[Cases((1063, 85), (1000, 80), (1, 0), (7, 1))]
test "8% rounds half up" (i64 cents, i64 expected) {
    let tax = try Money { cents: cents, currency: .myr }.atRate(800);
    assert(tax.cents == expected);
}

test "mixed currencies fail" {
    let myr = Money { cents: 100, currency: .myr };
    let sgd = Money { cents: 100, currency: .sgd };
    let _ = myr.plus(sgd) catch { return; };
    panic("expected currencyMismatch");
}

test "add commutes for same-currency amounts" {
    for i in 0..200 {
        let a = Money { cents: i * 37 - 3000, currency: .myr };
        let b = Money { cents: i * 91 - 9000, currency: .myr };
        let ab = try a.plus(b);
        let ba = try b.plus(a);

Expected: all tests pass (four `format` cases, four rounding cases, two single tests).

## Part E — Response

Write `docs/suq-round3-review-response.md` containing:

1. **Part A.** For each decision, the files and lines changed in the round-3 docs, and any conflict with what the docs said before.
2. **Part B.** A table with columns F-#, plan step (J-#, or "new"), whether the docs already answer it, what they say, and your recommendation where you disagree.
3. **Part C.** A table with columns item, GRAMMAR/SPEC reference, and matches or differs. For anything that differs, quote the text.
4. **Part D.**
   - Pass/fail for each Sūq-0 file, with the commit sha.
   - The syntax-change log (D3).
   - Any `.stdout` diffs with their cause (D2).
   - The workarounds and Questions you opened (D4).
   - The zero-allocation test result (D5).
5. **Attachments, as paths:**
   - The current round-3 HANDOFF.
   - The round-3 plan (J1–J25).
   - The Q89–Q127 list (specs 006 and 007) with the conservative choice made for each. Sy will review these against Sūq's use of interfaces and lambdas before they merge.
