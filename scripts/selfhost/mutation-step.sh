# The filtered tests are recorded once (BAYAN_SNAPSHOT) against schemata builds whose sites lie only in the files, then
# `bayan mutate --binary` runs every site of each build, replaying the recording per mutant (replay.py); sites under
# `@unobservable because "…"` come back marked, not survived. The reports are copied to <log dir>/quality-<n>-<binary>.json.
# Problems go to the caller's note() (which fills its FAIL array: the step runs only while FAIL is empty). Returns 0 when it
# reached the per-build runs, 1 when the CLI, the recording or the manifest stopped it before. A recording whose tests ran and
# failed is noted as `mutation: recording under BAYAN_SNAPSHOT: N test(s) failed`, naming each; any other recording failure
# (no test ran, the host crashed) as `mutation: recording the tests under BAYAN_SNAPSHOT failed`.
