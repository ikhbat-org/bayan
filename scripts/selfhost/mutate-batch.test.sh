# mutate-batch.sh on a tiny fixture with a stub `dotnet` and a stub `bayan` CLI at the repo's build path (no dotnet needed),
# the way guard.test.sh stubs them, and a fixture tasks file: --list derives each file's filter from the *Tests.cs classes of
# the tasks naming it (sorted union, a glob class skipped, a class of another family dropped, the family default when none is left, a bare basename when unique, a {a,b} path) and falls back to the
# directory default, an unknown directory fails naming it; a family's files share one group, one union filter and one recording
# (Q910); --shard k/n puts each file in exactly one shard, --files then limits the files; the reports land in tmp/mutate-batch/<group>/; an empty baseline is filled, a higher score replaces a lower
# one, a drop fails naming the file with old and new score and leaves the baseline unchanged; a failed mutant 0, a missing CLI
# and a manifest-less recording fail naming the group, the other groups still raise the baseline; a failed group's reports are
# moved to rejected/ (a score drop moves every OK group's reports there too) and not matched by the merge job's glob; the copied reports' absolute
# paths (as bayan mutate writes them) are rewritten repo-root-relative, a path outside the root or one that is no file under the
# root or selfhost/ fails the group naming the report; --files keeps the group's union filter; a score drop exits 1 and a failed group
# 3; a live tmp/mutate-batch.lock stops a second run (exit 3) and leaves it alone, a stale one is taken over, the lock is released; .github/workflows/mutation.yml: read-only permissions, no persisted credentials, a concurrency group, shards upload
# reports and not the baseline, a final job needing the shards merges all reports in one update, uploads the accepted reports, and documents applying the run.
