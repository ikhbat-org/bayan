Read: `AGENTS.md`, `scripts/selfhost/bayan-cheatsheet.md`, the task below, the C# it names (whole methods), the port {', '.join('`'+b+'`' for b in byns)}, the tests {', '.join('`'+x+'`' for x in tests)}, and Questions {('Q'+q[0]+'–Q'+q[1]) if q else 'for this task'} in `docs/bayan-handoff.md`.

## Task (verbatim)
{chr(10).join(block)}

## Entry points
{chr(10).join(own_api) or '(file-private only)'}

## The bar (a task fails if any of these is not met)
1. **Method for method.** Every C# method in the task's range exists, in C# order, with every branch, diagnostic code, message, label, help, fix span and report order. Logic that is not in the C# is a finding, however reasonable it looks.
2. **No stand-ins.** A call to a sibling's entry point goes to that entry point even while it is a stub. A fallback for when the sibling returns a default (`-1`, `false`, empty), a re-implementation of a sibling's function, a fake handle (`body = 0`), or a guard that skips a sibling call is HIGH.
3. **No silent gaps.** A C# field or state with no home in `Ctx`/`Binder` goes in the task's own `// ── {t} state` section of {shared}. Dropping it, approximating it (scope depth for scope identity, a path prefix for a loading list, a field scan for a dictionary), or leaving a function empty without `(blocked: Qnnn)` is HIGH.
4. **Oracle tests.** Every ported function has a test whose expected lines come from running the C# implementation in-process on the same input (see `{BRIEF[SPEC]['oracle']}`), including a failure/diagnostic path; diagnostics compare as `code line:col message`. Hand-typed expectations, or expectations that hold only because a sibling is a stub, are MEDIUM each (HIGH if they encode behaviour that differs from the C#).
5. **True docs.** Each Question in the task's range says what the code does; each break-test line citation points at the line it names. A false claim is MEDIUM.

Verify each finding in the code before you write it: name the Bayan `file:line` and the C# `file:line`. Run the task's tests (`dotnet test -v q --filter "{filt}"`) once; you may add a probe under `tmp/review-{t.lower()}/` to confirm a behaviour.

Cite format (`scripts/selfhost/preflight.sh` checks every `path:N` in the review file before landing): a `path:N` takes, in the same clause, a backticked symbol that is on line N or the 2 lines after it at HEAD. For a line as it was in an earlier commit, or one with no symbol to name, write `path (line N)`. On a re-review your block replaces the whole file: carry every earlier row with its status.

## Write `{row['dir']}/reviews/{t}.md`, exactly this shape
```
# {t} review
Commit: <git rev-parse HEAD>
Verdict: PASS | FAIL

| # | Severity | Finding (Bayan file:line — C# file:line) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | HIGH | … | open |
```
Status is `open`, `fixed` (only for a re-review that saw the fix) or `resolved: Qnnn` (a Question records a dispatcher decision that accepts it). `Verdict: PASS` only when no HIGH and no MEDIUM row is `open`. End your final message with the verdict and the counts per severity.
