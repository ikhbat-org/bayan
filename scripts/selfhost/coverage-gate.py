# coverage-gate.py — the per-task coverage gate of guard.sh (spec 013 T26).
#   python3 -I scripts/selfhost/coverage-gate.py <merge-base> <bayan-quality.json> <functions.json> [<tasks.md> <T<n>> <dir>]
# Run from the repo root. functions.json, written beside the report by the selfhost harness, gives each counted file's
# functions: their line span and their own covered/total lines and branches (a counter counts in the innermost function
# holding its line). A function is touched when its span holds a line the work tree adds or changes against <merge-base>
# (git diff -U0; a deletion touches the lines on either side of it; a file new since <merge-base> is touched throughout).
# Every line and branch of a touched function must be covered: each missed or unknown one is printed as a FAIL item
# ("- …"), except a missed one under a `// coverage-exempt: Qnnn` marker: it exempts the next line (`… through `text``: the next
# line to the one line holding text in the rest of the marker's function, an anchor, Q1040) when Question Qnnn of
# docs/bayan-questions.md or docs/decisions/2026-11-14-004-answered-questions.md (a numbered entry or a table row) cites a <file> line (any: its number is prose, Q1040), for code that is dead in the C# too (the Question cites the C# line). A marker whose
# Question cites no line of its file, or whose anchor matches no line or several, is a FAIL item and exempts nothing; so is a
# `through N` line number. An unknown line is never exempt.
# `// coverage-blocked: Qnnn T<k> <fn>` (`… through `text`` as above; user decision 2026-11-04) exempts a missed line that only runs once
# sibling task T<k> ports its stub <fn> (not dead in the C#: the Question cites the line and the stub). It holds only while T<k> is
# unticked in <tasks.md> and is not the task under guard (<T<n>>): every marker in <dir>'s .byn files naming the guarded task or a
# ticked one is a FAIL item, so the stub's owner covers the lines and removes the marker before it lands, and integration sees none.
# Without the three optional arguments a coverage-blocked marker is a FAIL item.
# A file under another row's bydir in scripts/selfhost/specs.tsv (read beside this script) that exists at <merge-base> is another
# spec's port (an 011 task editing selfhost/semantics): only the
# lines the work tree adds or changes in it are gated, since the rest of its functions is the owning spec's coverage (Q871). A file outside every bydir (selfhost/parser) or inside <dir> keeps the touched-function rule. The other functions of the file are one info line (covered/total), never a FAIL: the task's --filter tests are
# not meant to cover other tasks' functions. A source file absent from the work tree has no markers. An unreadable report, function or source file, or a failing git, exits 1 naming it.
