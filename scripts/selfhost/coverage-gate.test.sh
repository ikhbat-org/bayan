# coverage-gate.py's coverage-exempt markers: a marker whose Question cites a line of its file exempts its span's missed
# lines and branches (`through `text`` a range to the one line holding text, Q1040), and the file gets one count line; a marker
# whose Question cites no line of its file, an anchor matching no line or two, and a `through N` line number are FAIL items; an unknown line under a marker and a missed line outside every marker stay FAIL items;
# a file absent from the work tree has no markers, so its missed line in a touched function stays a FAIL item.
# coverage-blocked markers (second fixture): one naming an open sibling task exempts its span and gets its own count line; one
# naming the guarded task or a ticked task is a FAIL item (also in a file outside the report) and exempts nothing; a malformed one
# is a FAIL item; without a tasks file every coverage-blocked marker is a FAIL item.
