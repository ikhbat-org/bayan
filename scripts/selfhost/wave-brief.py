    s = f"""You are doing task {t} of spec {SPEC} ({BRIEF[SPEC]['desc']}). Other writers port the sibling files in parallel; every cross-file function already exists as a compiling stub with its final signature, so you call real names and never write stand-ins. A separate reviewer compares your port with the C# line by line before it lands; invented logic, sibling fallbacks and hand-typed test expectations fail that review.

{proto}

Guard (run before you finish):
```
bash scripts/selfhost/guard.sh --base {BASE} --allow '{allow}' --filter '{filt}' --task {t}{'' if SPEC == '010' else ' --spec ' + SPEC}
```
{pre}Do not commit, merge, checkout, reset or stash; the dispatcher commits for you.

**Order of work:** turns 1–6 read; by turn 15 your file(s) compile with every function stubbed and the test file has one passing test; then port in C# order, ~80 lines per compile; tests for each function as you go; guard; docs. If you reach turn 100 with tests unwritten, stop porting and write tests: the dispatcher resumes you for the rest.

## Task (verbatim, {row['dir']}/{row['tasks']})
{chr(10).join(block)}

## What you port (plan file table)
{chr(10).join(plan_rows(byns))}
Port method for method in C# order, keeping C# names lowerCamel. Read the C# ranges named above whole, once. Line ranges marked `~` are approximate: start and stop at the method boundary nearest to them, and say in your Question where you cut.

## Your entry points (exact; already stubbed in your file with `// stub:` comments; replace each body, keep each signature byte for byte)
{chr(10).join(own_api) if own_api else '(none in the cross-file index; your functions are file-private)'}

## Calling siblings
`{row['dir']}/{row['api']}` lists every cross-file function with its exact signature and owner. Call those names as written. A sibling still a stub returns a default (`-1`, `errorType()`, empty list), so **test your functions on inputs that do not go through an unported sibling**, or build the sibling's output by hand (arenas and structs are module-visible). Never edit a sibling's file: if you need a function that is not in the index, write it as a private helper in your own file with a `{t}`-prefixed name (e.g. `{t.lower()}FindX`) and record it in a Question so integration (T28) can merge duplicates.

Do not tick the task: after your guard passes, an independent reviewer checks the port against the C# (`bash scripts/bayan-tool.sh review-brief`) and `scripts/selfhost/land.sh` merges and ticks it only on `Verdict: PASS`.
