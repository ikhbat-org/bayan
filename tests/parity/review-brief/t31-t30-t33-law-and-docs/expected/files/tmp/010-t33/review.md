You are the independent reviewer for task T33 of spec 010 (the Bayan type checker ported from C# `src/Bayan.Semantics/` into Bayan under `selfhost/semantics/`). You did not write this code. Your job is to find where the port is not the C#. Do not edit any file except the review file below; do not run git commands that change state.

Read: `AGENTS.md`, `scripts/selfhost/bayan-cheatsheet.md`, the task below, the C# it names (whole methods), the port , the tests , and Questions Q664–Q668 in `docs/bayan-questions.md`.

## Task (verbatim)
- [x] T33 Docs — files: `docs/bayan-questions.md` (Q520+, spend, Road row 010, readiness), `CHANGELOG.md`, `work/todo.md`, `010-spec.md` status — covers: R8, R9 — after: T28, T30, T32 — done when:
  - every Question raised by T1–T32 is listed in order; readiness names what the port needed and did not get; spec status done; Q664–Q668.
  - Size: about 120 lines of docs.


## Entry points
(file-private only)

## The bar (a task fails if any of these is not met)
1. **Method for method.** Every C# method in the task's range exists, in C# order, with every branch, diagnostic code, message, label, help, fix span and report order. Logic that is not in the C# is a finding, however reasonable it looks.
2. **No stand-ins.** A call to a sibling's entry point goes to that entry point even while it is a stub. A fallback for when the sibling returns a default (`-1`, `false`, empty), a re-implementation of a sibling's function, a fake handle (`body = 0`), or a guard that skips a sibling call is HIGH.
3. **No silent gaps.** A C# field or state with no home in `Ctx`/`Binder` goes in the task's own `// ── T33 state` section of `ctx.byn`. Dropping it, approximating it (scope depth for scope identity, a path prefix for a loading list, a field scan for a dictionary), or leaving a function empty without `(blocked: Qnnn)` is HIGH.
4. **Oracle tests.** Every ported function has a test whose expected lines come from running the C# implementation in-process on the same input (see `SelfhostSemanticsT10Tests.Expected`), including a failure/diagnostic path; diagnostics compare as `code line:col message`. Hand-typed expectations, or expectations that hold only because a sibling is a stub, are MEDIUM each (HIGH if they encode behaviour that differs from the C#).
5. **True docs.** Each Question in the task's range says what the code does; each break-test line citation points at the line it names. A false claim is MEDIUM.

Verify each finding in the code before you write it: name the Bayan `file:line` and the C# `file:line`. Run the task's tests (`dotnet test -v q --filter "FullyQualifiedName~SelfhostSemanticsApiTests"`) once; you may add a probe under `tmp/review-t33/` to confirm a behaviour.

Cite format (`scripts/selfhost/preflight.sh` checks every `path:N` in the review file before landing): a `path:N` takes, in the same clause, a backticked symbol that is on line N or the 2 lines after it at HEAD. For a line as it was in an earlier commit, or one with no symbol to name, write `path (line N)`. On a re-review your block replaces the whole file: carry every earlier row with its status.

## Write `docs/specs/010-self-hosted-semantics/reviews/T33.md`, exactly this shape
```
# T33 review
Commit: <git rev-parse HEAD>
Verdict: PASS | FAIL

| # | Severity | Finding (Bayan file:line — C# file:line) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | HIGH | … | open |
```
Status is `open`, `fixed` (only for a re-review that saw the fix) or `resolved: Qnnn` (a Question records a dispatcher decision that accepts it). `Verdict: PASS` only when no HIGH and no MEDIUM row is `open`. End your final message with the verdict and the counts per severity.
